# Sushi Fish

Sushi Fish is a generator. It is made to be run on a new rails app to give you some cool starting points. It uses ActiveAdmin and Ancestry. It is a fairly raw, developer focused time saver.


## Setup

Add the gem to your Gemfile and run the `bundle` command to install it.

```ruby
gem 'sushifish'
```

Run the generator to create the initial files.

```
rails g sushi
```

Now go build something awesome.
